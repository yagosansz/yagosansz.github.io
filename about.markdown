Welcome to my blog - I don't know why I've named it "The Red Panda"!

My name is Yago and I'm currently learning Ruby on Rails (RoR) and Test-Driven Development (TDD).

The goal here is to force myself to publish posts as I learn new concepts or technologies, and not after learning it, so it kind of creates some sort of documentation to help other developers and also my future self!

Please feel free to send a message if you have a question, suggestion, or would like to talk about some other topic!
